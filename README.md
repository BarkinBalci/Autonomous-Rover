# Autonomous-Rover

The Autonomous Rover for Wildlife Surveillance is a project aimed at developing a self-driving vehicle for monitoring wildlife and detecting environmental threats, such as wildfires, poaching, and illegal logging. The project's goal is to create a reliable, cost-effective, and efficient solution for conserving natural resources and protecting wildlife.

The project will involve the design, development, and deployment of an autonomous rover equipped with various sensors, including thermal imaging, stero cameras, and acoustic sensors. The rover will be programmed to patrol wildlife reserves, national parks, and other natural habitats, collecting data on animal populations, vegetation, and weather conditions.

The rover will be equipped with machine learning algorithms to detect and classify different types of threats, such as wildfire smoke, gunshot sounds, and chainsaw noise. The system will also have the capability to identify and track individual animals, such as elephants, rhinos, and tigers, using computer vision and AI techniques.

The rover will be powered by renewable energy sources, such as solar panels and batteries, to reduce its carbon footprint and increase its autonomy. It will have a rugged and weather-resistant design to withstand harsh environmental conditions and ensure long-term operation in the field.

The data collected by the rover will be transmitted to a central database for analysis and monitoring by wildlife conservation organizations and government agencies. The system will generate real-time alerts and notifications to facilitate rapid response to any environmental threats detected.

The success of this project will depend on a collaborative effort between engineers, conservationists, and stakeholders to develop a cost-effective and scalable solution for monitoring and protecting natural habitats and wildlife. The project's long-term goal is to create a sustainable and robust system for ensuring the conservation and protection of endangered species and their habitats.
