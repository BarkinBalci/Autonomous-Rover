# Autonomous-Rover

The Autonomous Rover for Wildlife Surveillance is a self-driving vehicle designed for monitoring wildlife and detecting environmental threats, such as wildfires, poaching, and illegal logging. The project aimed to create a reliable, cost-effective, and efficient solution for conserving natural resources and protecting wildlife.

The project involved the design, development, and deployment of an autonomous rover equipped with various sensors, including thermal imaging, high-resolution cameras, and acoustic sensors. The rover is programmed to patrol wildlife reserves, national parks, and other natural habitats, collecting data on animal populations, vegetation, and weather conditions.

The rover is equipped with machine learning algorithms to detect and classify different types of threats, such as wildfire smoke, gunshot sounds, and chainsaw noise. The system can also identify and track individual animals, such as elephants, rhinos, and tigers, using computer vision and AI techniques.

The rover is powered by renewable energy sources, such as solar panels and batteries, to reduce its carbon footprint and increase its autonomy. It has a rugged and weather-resistant design to withstand harsh environmental conditions and ensure long-term operation in the field.

The data collected by the rover is transmitted to a central database for analysis and monitoring by wildlife conservation organizations and government agencies. The system generates real-time alerts and notifications to facilitate rapid response to any environmental threats detected.

The success of this project depended on a collaborative effort between engineers, conservationists, and stakeholders to develop a cost-effective and scalable solution for monitoring and protecting natural habitats and wildlife. The project's goal was to create a sustainable and robust system for ensuring the conservation and protection of endangered species and their habitats.
